## Introduction
This project implements a near full-fludged configuation for **Neovim**, using pure Lua langugae. This makes it possible for developers to use Neovim as an IDE.

Also, if you are a newcomer from other editors, you can use this project as a stand for your own, it is well organized so that you can start one step at a time.

**Caution:**

The project is not fully tested, you may find bugs quite possibly, please submit an issue so that I can fix it.

Thank you!
